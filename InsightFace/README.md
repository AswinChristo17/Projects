# Face Recognition System

This project implements a deep learning-based face recognition system using PyTorch and InsightFace. It classifies faces as either "known" or "unknown" using embeddings.

## Features
- Uses InsightFace for face embedding extraction.
- Classifies faces using a PyTorch neural network.
- Supports training and validation with dataset splitting.
- Saves known face embeddings for future use.

## Requirements
Ensure you have all dependencies installed. You can install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
