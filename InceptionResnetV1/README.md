Face Recognition with MTCNN and InceptionResnetV1

This project implements a face recognition system using MTCNN for face detection and InceptionResnetV1 for face recognition. The solution also includes training a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier for labeling detected faces and evaluating the model on a dataset.

Features

Face Detection: Uses MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for detecting faces in images.

Face Recognition: Utilizes InceptionResnetV1 to extract face embeddings for recognition.

Classifier: Trains a k-NN classifier to associate embeddings with labels.

Performance Metrics: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
