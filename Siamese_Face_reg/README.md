Siamese Neural Network for Binary Face Recognition

Overview

This project implements a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) for binary face recognition using the IFW dataset. A Siamese network is a type of neural network architecture designed for similarity learning, making it effective for tasks such as face verification.

Features

Utilizes a Siamese Neural Network to compare pairs of face images.

Trained using the IFW dataset.

Implements contrastive loss to optimize the model for similarity learning.

Uses TensorFlow and Keras for model development.

Supports real-time face verification.

Dataset

The IFW dataset (Images of Faces in the Wild) is used for training and testing. This dataset contains diverse facial images with variations in pose, illumination, and expression.
